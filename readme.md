## Project Idea 1 : Stuff Exchange

Project description:
Don't we all want to exchange stuff once we are done using it or are probably bored with it?
Tired of buying a costume every year for Hallowen and never using it again? Exchange it!
Have a dress but it doesn't fit anymore? Exchange it!
We offer a way to fullfil your wish!
We offer the following services:
1) Let user login securely.
2) Browse for items that are up for exchange.
3) Choose the items for exchange.
4) You will get a notification if and only if both the parties agree on the exchange.
5) Chat with the item owners and negotiate. Voila!
You now own something new and exciting that you can actually use!
